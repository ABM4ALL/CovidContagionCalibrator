# README

This CovidContagionCalibrator model [[doc](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/gallery/covid_contagion_calibrator.html)] 
is built on top of the [CovidContagion](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidContagion) 
model to show how the ``Calibrator`` module of **Melodie** can be implemented.
If you haven't, we will strongly suggest to read the 
[documentation](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/tutorial.html) of the **CovidContagion** first.
